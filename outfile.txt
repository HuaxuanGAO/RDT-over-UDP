Programming Assignment 2
Due Date: Friday, December 10th, 11:59PM
In this programming assignment, you will be writing the sending and receiving transport-level
code for implementing a simplified version of TCP. Your version will use a network loss, delay
and corruption link emulator provided by us. Data is exchanged via UDP, i.e., you will be running
TCP "on top of" UDP. The network can drop, corrupt, reorder and delay packets. You will need
to run one copy of the emulator, as acknowledgements are assumed to arrive without delay or
loss. Please use version 1.7 of the emulator.
You can run your sender, receiver and the link emulator either on one, two or three machines.
The link emulator acts like a "proxy", i.e., the sender is configured to send packets there and the
proxy is configured to send packets to the receiver. The receiver process sends its
acknowledgements directly to the data sender.
For testing, run the following command:
newudpl -iinput_host_address -ooutput_host_address -L 50Programming Assignment 2
